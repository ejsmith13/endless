## Description:

For this project, I recreated a webpage from an image given to me. I used HTML5 to create the page and styled it with CSS3. There is a modal that pops up when the "get started" button is clicked. It uses JavaScript to change the display property, making it visible, and can redirect the user to the project's Github repo.
